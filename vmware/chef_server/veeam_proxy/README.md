## Requirements

- [Terraform 0.11.8+](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Chef Server 12+
- Windows 2012R2 or Windows 2016 VMware Template
- vSphere Credentials

## Getting Started
The Terraform templates included in this repository requires Terraform to be available locally on the machine running the templates.  Before you begin, please verify that you have the following information:

1. Download [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (minimum tested version 0.11.8) binary to your workstation.
2. Gather the VMware credentials required to communicate to vCenter
3. Find the VMware template name to use and the VMware folder to which the machines would be deployed.
4. Register for a [Hosted Chef](https://manage.chef.io/signup) account or if using Chef on-premises, then get a username and private key file.
5. Get the Chef Organization URL to use.
6. Save a copy of the file `terraform.tfvars.example` as `terraform.tfvars`
7. Update the variable values in the newly created `terraform.tfvars` file.
8. Run `terraform init` to install the required plugins and modules
9. Test the variables and templates by running `terraform plan`
10. If everything looks good, then create the environment by running `terraform apply`

## Veeam Backup and Replication ISO
The attribute `node['veeam']['version']` is used to evaluate the ISO download path and checksum for the installation media.  When provided, the version selected will be downloaded based on the value found in `libraries/helper.rb`.  This media path can be overridden by providing the appropriate installation media attributes - `node['veeam']['installer']['package_url']` and `node['veeam']['installer']['package_checksum']`.  By default, these attributes are `nil` and the system will download the ISO every time.

## Terraform Execution Commands
Below is a list of different command options when executing Terraform.

| Command | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terraform init` | Downloads all of the required plugins for Terraform to execute these templates. | Creates a .terraform directory in the location of the templates and pulls the current plugin versions. |
| `terraform plan` | Runs validation checks against the Terraform templates and variables. | When run, it will display a list of changed items and what will be created or updated. |
| `terraform apply` | Applies the Terraform templates to create the infrastructure needed to satisfy the configuration. If the `-auto-approve` switch is added, then it will by pass the *Should proceed?* question. | By default, will create only a new Veeam Backup and Replication server unless the `terraform.tfvars` file has the variable `proxy_count` set to a value greater than 0. |
| `terraform apply -var proxy_count=2 | Applies the Terraform templates to create the infrastructure needed to satisfy the configuration and overrides the value for the variable `proxy_count`. | Variable values are selected by first the default value in `variables.tf`, second the value in the `terraform.tfvars` file, and third the command line value provided. In this case, we are overriding the number of proxy servers to create.  If previous executions set the value of `proxy_count` to 3, then this command would remove the last proxy server and leave only two proxy hosts. |
| `terraform destroy` | Reverses the entire configuration and destroys the infrastructure. If the `-force` switch is added, then it will by pass the *Should proceed?* question. | Note: This will delete everything in your environment based on the templates.  If you only want to remove the proxies, then you can simply set the `proxy_count` variable as mentioned previously. |
| `terraform apply -var proxy_count=1 -var should_register_proxy=false` | This command will build the Veeam VBR server and deploy one Proxy Server but not register the proxy to VBR. | This command is handy for staging a new Proxy Server template.  By deploying in this manner:<ol><li>you can prestage the installation of the Veeam components</li><li>shutdown the machine</li><li>clone to a new template</li><li>then power on the machine</li><li>finally, run the process again using `terraform apply -var proxy_count=0` to delete the proxy cleanly</li></ol>|
